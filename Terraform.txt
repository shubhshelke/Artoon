#vi file1.tf  ---create file

search aws terraform provider

1. connect AWS with terraform

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

#ls -a
#terraform init --- Download all plugins 
#ls -a
#.terraform  ----In this directory we having executable file(For terraform). press tab tab



2. Go to AWS console
   go to IAM and create user 
   Give programatic access 
   Give Administration access
   then 
   create and download Access key and secrete key



3. Authentication and Configuration
   Login terraform in aws account using IAM user Access key and secrete key.
   Go to terraform website
   scroll and 
   In Authentication and Configuration
   in credentials copy that code and paste in file1.tf

provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"          ----choose region
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
}


4. Create EC2 instance 
   Go to terraform website and left side choose EC2
   then click on AWS instance
   choose small code to create one server
   
resource "aws_instance" "s1" {
  ami           = "ami-007855ac798b5175e"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "server1"
  }
}

#terraform validate       ---show error in file or code
#terraform init           ---Download plugines
#terraform plan           ---show which things we are createing
#terraform apply          ---create all things mensioned in .tf file
#terraform destroy        ---destroy all things created by terraform



5.create multiple EC2 instances like 3

resource "aws_instance" "s1" {
  ami           = "ami-007855ac798b5175e"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "server1"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "s2" {
  ami           = "ami-007855ac798b5175e"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "server2"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "s3" {
  ami           = "ami-007855ac798b5175e"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "server3"
  }
}

#terraform validate       ---show error in file or code
#terraform plan           ---show which things we are createing
#terraform apply          ---create all things mensioned in .tf file
#terraform destroy        ---destroy all things created by terraform
