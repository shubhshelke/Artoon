To set up port forwarding in a NAT network on VM VirtualBox, follow these steps:

Start by opening VirtualBox and selecting the virtual machine you want to configure.
Click on the "Settings" button and select the "Network" option from the left-hand menu.
In the "Adapter 1" tab, ensure that "NAT" is selected as the "Attached to" option.
Click on the "Advanced" drop-down arrow to expand the advanced network settings.
Click on the "Port Forwarding" button to access the port forwarding configuration options.
Click on the "+" button to add a new port forwarding rule.
In the "Name" field, enter a name for the rule (e.g., "SSH").
In the "Protocol" field, select the protocol for the rule (e.g., TCP).
In the "Host IP" field, enter "127.0.0.1" if you want to forward the port to the host machine, or enter another IP address
 if you want to forward the port to a specific machine on your network.
In the "Host Port" field, enter the port number you want to forward (e.g., 22 for SSH).
In the "Guest IP" field, enter the IP address of the virtual machine (you can find this in the virtual machine by running the "ip addr" command).
In the "Guest Port" field, enter the port number that the application or service is running on in the virtual machine (e.g., 22 for SSH).
Click "OK" to save the port forwarding rule.
Repeat steps 6-13 for any additional port forwarding rules you want to set up.
Click "OK" to close the network settings window.
Once you've set up port forwarding in the NAT network on your virtual machine, 
you should be able to connect to the application or service running in the virtual machine from your host machine by using the host IP address 
and port number you specified in the port forwarding rule.
